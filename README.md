# Ten-Digit-Number-Problem
A Java algorithm and a UI created with the JavaFX graphics library which both verifies a user imputed ten-digit number and finds a unique ten-digit number where each sub number is divisible by its length (ex. 38165/5 = 7633). 
The algorithm to create a valid ten-digit-number uses recursion and backtracking to start at number nine and cycle through, add, and remove digits until a valid number is created.
